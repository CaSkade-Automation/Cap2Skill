It allows for real-time monitoring and adjustment of the joint states, enabling the robot to perform complex movements accurately.\n\nUsage in the ROS2 System:\nThis topic is typically published by the joint trajectory controller node and subscribed to by nodes responsible for monitoring or controlling the robot's movement.
